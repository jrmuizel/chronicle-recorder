Chronicle records every memory and register write in the execution of a Linux process, using Valgrind to instrument execution at the machine code and system call level. These events are indexed and compressed; from the resulting database the Chronicle query tool can efficiently reconstruct the state of memory and/or registers at any point during the execution. Additional queries such as "when was the last write to location X before time T" and "when was location X executed between times T1 and T2" are also supported. This infrastructure has a variety of possible uses, but the most obvious use is as the basis for powerful debuggers.

Chronicle by itself is not all that useful to anyone except tool builders. If you're looking for a useful debugger, try [Chronomancer](http://code.google.com/p/chronomancer), an Eclipse-based UI for debugging C and C++ programs using Chronicle.
